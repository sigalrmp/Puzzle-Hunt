        "### Data Types\n",
        "In Python, there are **data types**, which represent categories of values that **variables** can store, and this determines what can happen to these variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some data types:\n",
        "- Text-based values are strings, which Python labels as `str`. Examples: `\"wow\"`, `'string'`, `\"s\"`, `'here'`. Note that there's no difference between `' '` and `\" \"`. `chr()` takes an integer for an input, and converts it into a character.\n",
        "- Numeric-based variables are integers or floats (integers are whole numbers, floats are decimals), which Python labels as `int` and `float` respectively. Examples: `1`, `123232`, `1.3123`. Note that there are no quotes around these values.\n",
        "- Boolean values are true/false, which Python labels as `bool`. There are only two possible values for values that are boolean: `True` and `False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "These data types are **case sensitive**. That means that upper-case letters are not equivalent to lower-case letters (`\"too\"` and `\"Too\"` are not the same)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Functions\n",
        "**Functions** are chunks of code. If you've ever used Scratch, it's essentially the same thing. These functions can be called, and the chunk of code that's in the function will run.\n",
        "\n",
        "Like a math function, some functions have inputs. The function can utilize this input to create an output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example of a Python function:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def foo(number):\n",
        "  # where all the code goes here.\n",
        "  # make sure that your code is indented!!!!!\n",
        "  # By the way, by putting a # in front of the line, it creates a comment! Comments are not run\n",
        "  return number + 3\n",
        "```\n",
        "`foo` is the name of the function, and `number` is the input. `return` allows you to return an output for the function. Note that since 3 is being added to `number`, Python assumes `number` is a numeric value (int, float).\n",
        "Functions can be called. For instance:\\\n",
        "`foo(4)` would be equal to `7`.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be stored in a **variable**, which allows it to be called later.\n",
        "```python\n",
        "new_num = foo(4)\n",
        "print(new_num)\n",
        "```\n",
        "`print()` is a built-in function that you can call to print values out. Note that it needs an input, and that this **is not the same as an output**. An output uses the `return` keyword, while `print()` just puts a value into the console so you can see it.\n",
        "\n",
        "If this code were run, then the console would show:\n",
        "```\n",
        "7\n",

        "\n",
        "For example, since `a` has a prime decimal value of `97`, we shift it up by `97 / 2`, yielding `145`. Since `145` is outside the range of lowercase letters, we take `(97 / 2) % 26`, then add that to `97` (where `a` starts), resulting in `119`, which corresponds to the final character of `w` according to the ASCII table. If this doesn't make sense, this is a [Caesar cipher](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/caesar-cipher-in-cryptography/), except the shift can be greater than 26 by taking the modulus of the shifting value."
